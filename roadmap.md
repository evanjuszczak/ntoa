Roadmap for Note-AI Web Application

Overview

This document outlines the roadmap for developing an open-source web application that allows users to log in via Google, upload PDF notes, and interact with an AI that provides answers based on the uploaded notes. The application will be hosted on GitHub for public use.
Features

User Authentication
Google login integration for user authentication.
Store user data securely (e.g., notes, preferences).
Note Uploading
Input for users to upload one or multiple PDF files.
Support for various note formats (e.g., Canvas, PowerPoint).
AI Interaction
Text input for users to ask questions or request information.
AI processes the uploaded notes to provide answers.
Option to search the web for additional information if needed (with user consent).
User Interface
Clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop users.
Data Storage
Store user notes and interactions in a database.
Ensure data privacy and security.
Roadmap Phases

Phase 1: Planning and Design

Tasks:
Define user stories and requirements.
Create wireframes and mockups for the UI.
Choose technology stack (e.g., React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB).
Set up GitHub repository and project board.
Phase 2: User Authentication

Tasks:
Implement Google OAuth for user login.
Set up user session management.
Create user profile page to manage notes.
Phase 3: Note Uploading

Tasks:
Develop the PDF upload feature.
Implement file validation and error handling.
Store uploaded notes in the database.
Phase 4: AI Integration

Tasks:
Research and select an AI model for processing notes (e.g., OpenAI's GPT).
Develop the backend logic to process notes and answer user queries.
Implement the text input for user questions.
Phase 5: Web Search Functionality

Tasks:
Implement a feature to search the web for additional information.
Create a user prompt for consent before searching the web.
Ensure that the AI prioritizes notes over web search results.
Phase 6: User Interface Development

Tasks:
Develop the front-end components based on wireframes.
Ensure responsive design for various devices.
Implement user-friendly navigation and interactions.
Phase 7: Testing and Quality Assurance

Tasks:
Conduct unit testing for individual components.
Perform integration testing for the entire application.
Gather user feedback through beta testing.
Phase 8: Deployment and Documentation

Tasks:
Deploy the application on a hosting platform (e.g., GitHub Pages, Heroku).
Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
Prepare a README file for the GitHub repository.
Phase 9: Maintenance and Future Enhancements

Tasks:
Monitor application performance and user feedback.
Implement new features based on user requests.
Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to developing the Note-AI web application. By following these phases, we aim to create a valuable tool for users to interact with their notes and enhance their learning experience. The open-source nature of the project will encourage community contributions and improvements.
